			<p> So the guy with white hair is named Tomoe. He is a fox yokai. He is also the familiar of the former land God, Mikage.
				    He became Nanami Momozono's familiar (the girl with brown hair) and the present Land God.
				    The anime is mainly about a spirit and a human that fell in love. But it was known that a spirit and a human's love story is taboo. Tomoe fell in love with a girl in the past
				    and to make it short, the girl died. Thus, Making Tomoe hate humans, thinking they're so fragile and weak. 500 years later, Nanami a normal highschooler went homeless when her mother died and her father left some unpaid debts.
				    But then a man named Mikage who's afraid of dogs came to the story and offered Nanami to live in his house. Mikage kissed her forehead and left.
				    Upon arriving at the location, Nanami noticed it was actually a shrine. And she met Tomoe. Tomoe disliking the fact that Nanami a human girl, became the land Lord left the shrine.
				    But Nanami went and convince Tomoe to become her familiar. At the end, Nanami successfully made Tomoe her familiar. 
				    They've had numerous adventures and met several people. By the end of season 2, they fell in love as Tomoe found out that the girl he fell in love with 500 years ago is actually Nanami's ancestor.</p>
